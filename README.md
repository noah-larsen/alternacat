# alternacat

Imagine two graph-theoretic forests, one of which is a single tree corresponding to product categories, and the second to a hierarchy of reasons why people buy products. Now imagine edges connecting the two forests, connecting one node from one forest to one node from the other forest, and using this structure to search for alternative categories that might be helpful in buying a product, given an interest in a particular category. This is how alternacat works.
